      "details": "An important law that protects the separation of church and state is the Johnson Amendment, which restricts churches and other 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates. If they do, they lose their tax-exempt status.\n\nOn February 2nd, Trump told an audience of religious leaders that he would \"totally destroy\" the Johnson Amendment. The same day, Republicans introduced a bill that threatens to subvert the Johnson Amendment by allowing churches to express political views. If Trump waters down or eliminates the Johnson Amendment, religious institutions would become major money players in our government. Tax-free donations to churches could be used to buy political advertisements and support campaigns.",

      "headline": "Keep Partisan Politics out of the National Security Council",
      "details": "On January 28th, Donald Trump reorganized the National Security Council (NSC) to include both Steve Bannon (Trump’s Chief Strategist and former chair of Breitbart media) and Reince Priebus (Trump’s Chief of Staff), while he reduced the roles of the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The purpose of the National Security Council is to provide the president with the best possible advice from his Cabinet, the military, and the intelligence community before he makes major decisions. Injecting partisan politics into the process of securing our nation is extremely dangerous.\n\nOn February 1st, U.S. Representative Stephanie Murphy introduced a bill (H.R. 804) to protect the NSC from political interference. This bill will ensure that no individual whose “primary responsibility is political in nature” is assigned to the NSC or authorized to attend NSC meetings, and it stresses that the Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have standing invitations to attend Principal Committee meetings. With this bill, Congresswoman Murphy hopes to \"...depoliticize national security so that we never jeopardize the safety and security of the American people.",

      "headline": "Take Action Against Climate Change",
      "details": "Climate change is not a hoax. According to NASA, \"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.\" 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree. These are the facts, backed up by research and data. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and other greenhouse gases naturally trap heat in the atmosphere. But human emissions disrupt the Earth’s delicate balance, causing global temperatures to rise and disrupting normal weather patterns. Melting ice caps result in rising sea levels, which intensify hurricanes and storms. All around the world, and especially in third-world countries such as Bangladesh, people are losing their homes to floods and soil erosion. The effects of climate change are very real for environmental refugees.\n\nOn January 24th, Representative Gary Palmer, a climate change denier, introduced HR 637 (the \"Stopping EPA Overreach Act\") with 84 House Republican co-sponsors. This bill seeks to strike the very words “greenhouse gases” from the Clean Air Act. It would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating “carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfer hexafluoride” emissions—in other words, factories would have free license to pollute the air with these substances. HR 637 would be a devastating strike against the Kigali Accord and other international efforts to fight climate change.",
